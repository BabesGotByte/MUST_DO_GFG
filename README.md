Maths:</br>

1- Missing in Array </br>
Given an array arr of size nâˆ’1 that contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n (inclusive), find the missing element. The array is a permutation of size n with one element missing. Return the missing element.</br>

2- Trailing zeroes in factorial </br>
For an integer N find the number of trailing zeroes in N!.</br>

3- A simple fraction</br>
Given a fraction. Convert it into a decimal. 
If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses</br>

4- Nth Natural Number</br>
Given a positive integer N. You have to find Nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9.</br>

5- Smallest Positive Integer that can not be represented as Sum</br>
Given an array of size N, find the smallest positive integer value that is either not presented in the array or cannot be represented as a sum(coz sum means you are adding two or more elements) of some elements from the array.</br>

Arrays:</br>

1- Equilibrium Point</br>
Given an array arr of non-negative numbers. The task is to find the first equilibrium point in an array. The equilibrium point in an array is an index (or position) such that the sum of all elements before that index is the same as the sum of elements after it.</br>

2- Array Leaders</br>
Given an array arr of n positive integers, your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element of the array is considered a leader if it is greater than all the elements on its right side or if it is equal to the maximum element on its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.</br>

3- Rotate Array</br>
Given an unsorted array arr[] of size n. Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by d steps, where d is a positive integer.
